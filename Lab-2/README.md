Collaborations: Carla Bonifaz helped me figure out how to convert my CSV file into a GeoJSON and then how to put that into GitHub. I helped her with the code to highlight different things with different colors. I took elements from the activity about highlighting, the first lab, and the activity that introduced leaflet. 

This map illustrates the location of all operable renewable energy plants listed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The map is designed for anyone interested in renewable energy in the U.S., as it brings insight on the location and type of renewable energy plants. It attempts to address relative quantities depending on location, and the distribution of different types of renewable energy sources across the country, including Alaska and Hawaii. Coal, gas and petroleum were omitted, as I wanted to focus solely on renewable energy and not on the proportion of clean energy plants versus those that rely on fossil fuels. The map is successful in this aspect by trying to remain true to the real distribution of the plants, having relatively small point symbols with some degree of transparency to show the cluttering effect of nearby plants without individual symbols being too opposing. It could be better by having the point symbols sizes represent the relative total amount of energy produced in each plant, but then this would have interfered with the pattern of distribution. The map is simple and clean. 

In terms of visual hierarchy and aesthetics, I decided to go for a black background that would contrast the lighter point symbols and go best with the energy theme, as the symbols look like lights. Another feature added for those purposes is that the six different types of renewable energy are color coded (to different extents, as there are no color associations with “pumped storage”), helping the map look less monotone. The downside to the dark background is that state and city names are slightly hard to read, and they pop up at certain zoom levels. The background map also has some annoying longitude lines that I couldn't get rid of. This map works at both small and large scales, with differing benefits as you zoom in further. At the smaller scales, it is easier to appreciate the distribution of symbols and the relative locations of the different types of energy. At larger scales, the relative position of the plants becomes less clear, but all city names and roads were kept to best show the actual location of the plants. Interactivity was added in the form of the buttons, the highlighting feature, and the pop ups showing the type of energy and technology used. The type of technology is most helpful with biomass energy, as the technologies used differ more than with the other energy sources. This was to add insight into the sources of energy and to be able to isolate the different types. 
The map could be improved by adding other types of interactivity, but I couldn’t figure out which kind would also be compatible with the data. I think linking the symbol sizes to the energy generated at each plant would could have worked as well.
