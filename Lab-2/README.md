Collaborations: Carla Bonifaz helped me figure out how to convert my CSV file into a GeoJSON and then how to put that into GitHub. I helped her with the code to highlight different things with different colors. I took elements from the activity about highlighting, the first lab, and the activity that introduced leaflet.
