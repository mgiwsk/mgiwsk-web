This map was designed with a specific purpose in mind, rather than a target audience. The idea was to create an interactive 3D virtual reality representation of a moment in geological time, in this case the Cretaceous period. I took inspiration from the discussion regarding the virtual reality reading, where I suggested that VR could help visualize the geological past, and I chose the Cretaceous because it is well known and it makes it friendlier to users who are not familiar with the topic. It’s supposed to help bring the past to life, with the hope that interacting with it could inspire users to learn more about it. It is successful in the sense that the 3D images are there, and so is the information, but unfortunately it did not turn out the way I intended it to. None of the interactivity I added ended up working and I still can’t figure out why. The text boxes were supposed to respond to a camera cursor and become enlarged as the camera dragged over it. When that didn’t work I tried using the disappear function we used in class, but it didn’t work. The background was supposed to be a beach, as I also wanted to provide information on sea level and marine life, but I struggled finding the proper animations. The biggest issue was time, and my lack of proficiency with A-Frame. The final product is not interactive, but the 3D models and their corresponding bits of information was there, as I decided it was better to have the text there at all times than none at all. 

I also struggled finding the connection between what I did and cartography. Other than visual hierarchy and scaling the objects to the best of my abilities, I’m having a hard time making the connection. At first I was very excited to bring my idea to life, trying to mix interactivity with panoramic and 3D images, but the more that I worked on it (and the more I kept failing at adding interactivity and animations), the more I wondered how my project could be useful or even related to the field. I still tried to make accurate, visually appealing and informative to the best of my (very limited) abilities. I’m disappointed that none of the interactivity came through, but I am happy with the 3D and aesthetic aspects of my creation and believe I was successful at representing a tiny bit of the Cretaceous.
