  This map represents past, present and prospective mining sites in Peru, according to data by the USGS (2005). The map is not detailed or precise enough to have any true scientific or economic purposes, but the aim is to illustrate the extent of mining in Peru and raise all sorts of questions, ranging from wondering about the geology of the country to the importance of sustainability in mining, or the importance of mining to the economy. The map is designed for anyone who is interested in mineralogical diversity, mining in general, or the country’s mining activity. It is, however, a purely qualitative assessment of mining. The base layer depicting relief was chosen to illustrate the geographical location of the minerals’ distributions, as mountain-building processes play an important role in ore formation. The roads and other connectivity networks were kept to show the context of the location of the sites. The point symbols were chosen because they represent discrete data best. I considered making it a heatmap, to show the concentration of mines around different areas, but the point symbols make the map work best at different scales and also make it possible to add interactivity—the tags, stating the name of the site, the ore, three degrees of commodities obtained from them, and the development status of the sites. Point symbols were chosen over polygons for similar reasons—polygons would have worked best at larger scales, when the map is zoomed in, but at smaller scales, point symbols look less cluttered and are easier to manage. Halos were added to soften the clutter and create a smooth pattern at smaller scales and still have all the benefits of point symbols at smaller scales. 
	
  The point symbols are divided into five categories, according to the development status of the mine: occurrence, prospective, producer, past producer, and unknown. This information is not vital, but it gives a more thorough and accurate perspective. For this reason, the colors assigned to each category are not too contrasting. The legend was omitted, as web maps have the advantage that they can be interactive and there are other ways in which to include this information. The meaning of the colors is not obvious, but after looking at the tags of a few different colored points it is easy to tell they represent the development status of the sites—the colors are also there to help the reader assume there is something that is different about all the symbols. It also helps in the visual assessment of the map, as when all the points are the same color, it is hard to discern depth in the pattern, and takes some of the interactivity away from the map. This way, the map looks more aesthetically pleasing as well. 
	
  Some issues came from the size of the dataset. There were around three thousand data points, and it was impossible to go through every single one of them to make sure everything was in order. Some data points had to be deleted because the coordinates didn’t match the province, country, and a couple fell on the water. Some of the point symbols did not respond to the styling—a few don’t have halos, and I could not figure out how to fix it, so they were left alone. The information in the tags could be more explicitly categorized, but again due the size of the dataset there was no time to fix it. The downside to point symbols is that at the largest scale, they don’t truly represent the size or extent of the mine; I tried to compensate for this with the Mapbox function that allows for the radius of the symbols to shift with the zoom. As for the cartographic principles that could make this map better, a frame would be useful, as there is no data outside of Peru and at smaller scales it is impractical to have a full screen with information that is irrelevant to the topic. A scale, north arrow, and a title would be good, and I would have also liked to add a citation for the data.

Carla Bonifaz helped me figure out the HTML part of the lab, as well as some export issues with my data layer.
